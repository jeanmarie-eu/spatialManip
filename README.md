# spatialManip

[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jeanmarielepioufle/spatialManip.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jeanmarielepioufle/spatialManip)

The R-package gathers simple functions to quickly manipulate spatial objects.

It has been decided to keep getting close from the sp R-packages and its source libraries.

The package has two purposes:
1. Easily and quickly extracting, building, comparing (contain) spatial objects.
2. Identify processes that are memory and cpu eaters for further improvement.
